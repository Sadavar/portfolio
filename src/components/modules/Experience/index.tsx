            This internship allowed me to get both technical and buisness experience on a software product built on technologies like ReactJS and Java Springboot.
            I worked on a team which developed NYL's internal consulting software, GuideMe, which is used by over 13,000 agents and managers to help in the sales process.
            Over the course of the program, I developed an accessbility feature which vastly improved visuals for those with colorblindess and other visual impairments, improved screen-reader support, and implemented video summarizing solutions.
            I also got experience with automating testing by using Selenium which vastly helped in the process. This experience was a great blend of technical and buisness skills and I learned a lot about how large softwares are developed and maintained. This was also my first time in NYC and I really fell in love with the city!

            In this internship I got a chance to work on a couple different projects. The first one was a a multi-threaded desktop application written in C++ and Qt which streamlined financial data parsing, making the process much faster and more efficient. I also got to work on a JavaScript app that seamlessly worked with a vast collection of electric pole diagrams and spreadsheets, dramatically speeding up data conversion. Lastly, I designed a central dashboard using PowerBI and Python that brought all key metrics and KPIs together in one place, enhancing team communication and collaboration. This role was a fantastic blend of problem-solving and innovation, allowing me to dive into diverse technologies and make a real impact on how data is managed and visualized.
